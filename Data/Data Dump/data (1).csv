"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5. The remote controls and charging port are on the right.6. No magnets on earpieces.7. Mediocre mic quality.My personal verdict : Definitely a great buy at INR 1,499.","JBL Tune 215BT : Best neckband for those who want bass but not in ear buds, with mediocre mic.",5.0,Positive

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5.

"Sound :The sound signature is Warm to almost V shaped and everything is clear even at max volume and low volume. Great for Indian songs and EDM and Rock.There is practically no passive noise cancellation but the neckband does get loud enough to drown out any noise and there isn't any kind of sound leakage upto 90% volume.Build and Fit:Solid build quality The wires are good and overall light weight coupled with the earpiece shape makes for a very comfortable listening experience for long hours.They fit well for even small ears and stay put no matter what you are doing. They are comfortable enough that you can sleep in them.They are low profile enough to fit in ears comfortable even while wearing a helmet.The raised power button is convenient when you want to activate assistant, and the double tap to activate assistant instead of long press is great so that you don't accidentally turn off the device.Connectivity :Generally low latency and Bluetooth 5.0 makes for a good experience but you can feel the lag while playing FPS if you look for it. The range is a huge improvement over bluetooth 4.0.Dual pairing works fine. When Switched ON the auto connect connects to both of the last paired devices automatically.But lets say you are connected to a phone and a laptop and you go out of laptop's range while you have the phone in hand with earphone then it won't reconnect to laptop automatically. Instead you will have to manually connect it on laptop from paired devices.Playback : There is no lag when switching devices when you receive calls on a different device than what you are listening to and it automatically paused the media playing on any device connected.If media is paused for over 5 seconds playing media in any of the two connected device begins instantaneously. But there is a 3 to 5 second interval depending on your device when switching media during continuous play back and it switches only when you pause the media thats already playing.Battery and charging : The battery last quite long. I don't have exact numbers but it lasted 4 hours in last 30% of charge with 50% volume.Type C charging is convenient and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge on a 18W adapter with included cable.Mic quality : Clear but very low volume. defenitely not recomended if calling is your main purpose. There is no Enviroinmental Noise Canellation either(ENC).Things to kmow before buying:1. Not recommended for those who prefer neutral or balanced sound.2. There is no intimation or notification chime when a device is disconnected from the neckband or when it goes out of range.3. The auto connect does not connect to second paired device automatically if you the second device goes out of range and comes back and you have to manually connect it from second device's ""Paired device list""4. When you play media on second device it doesn't pause the media playing on first device. But calls do pause any media playing from any device.5. The remote controls and charging port are on the right.6. No magnets on earpieces.7.

The dataset used in this project is a combination of web scraped data and already present big dataset of customer reviews for a specific product. The web scraped data was collected by using web scraping techniques and pre-processed to remove any irrelevant information. The combined dataset was then pre-processed to format it into a format that can be easily used for training and evaluating the model.


- Web Scraped data- [Data Dump](https://github.com/AaronANoronha/CustomerReviewAnalysis/tree/main/Data/Data%20Dump)
- Already existing dataset - [Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html)

Both combined is too large so there the link to the dataset:- [FINAL DATASET](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-7SYkvT6iKMcSTuwaGJj-0kfFslZC5VW/view?usp=sharing)

The dataset used in this project is a combination of web scraped data and already present big dataset of customer reviews for a specific product. The web scraped data was collected by using web scraping techniques and pre-processed to remove any irrelevant information. The combined dataset was then pre-processed to format it into a format that can be easily used for training and evaluating the model. The dataset is split into training and test sets, with a ratio of 80:20.

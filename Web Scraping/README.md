# Data Collection - Web Scraping
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It is typically done using a web scraping tool or a web scraping library, which sends an HTTP request to a website's server to retrieve the HTML content of the page. The HTML is then parsed and the desired information is extracted.

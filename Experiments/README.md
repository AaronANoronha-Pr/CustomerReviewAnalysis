# Experiments

- Before selecting a model, it is important to conduct experiments with different models and different embedding layers to determine which one performs the best. 
We tried different architectures, hyperparameters and pre-trained models to see which one performs the best. 
It is a good practice to evaluate the models using different evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score etc.

- Another important factor when selecting a model is the computational resources available. Some models are computationally expensive and may require powerful hardware 
to run effectively. It's important to consider the computational resources available when selecting a model and choose one that can be run effectively on the 
available resources.

"Verdict : A Solid buy for this price segment in 2022 (and even for early 2023)There are 2 reviews in this section. Review 1 is 30 days after purchase (Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now) and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update. These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022.Before OOS 13 update, 5G (only for Jio) was enabled via another update. 5G is still not available in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not covered in this review.Review 2: After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update (Android 13):(Update received on 1 Dec 2023).Note: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there were;No Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 (Android 13) update review:Delighters:> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).> Animations are more fluidic.> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)  (Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.> No improvement in Sound levels.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever. So the first thing I did was to get a back-cover with rubbery finish.2.",An all-rounder phone with flagship features at an affordable price point,5.0,Positive
"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great. Can give 100/100 point.Build Quality is superb.Finger-print is super fast.Mic and loud speaker is also great.",Overall good product,5.0,Positive

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever.

"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever.

"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever.

"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever.

"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever.

"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever.

"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever.

"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever.

"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever.

"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever.

"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever.

"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever.

"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever.

"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever.

"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it.

"I got this mobile (12Gb, 25Gb Ram variant)at 31k after 3k discount on icici credit card.For this price it's a must buy.I am using this product since last 2 weeks.The camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very well.The only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better, as a working professional it doesn't makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a day.If you have no issues with the battery section then just go for it.👍",Over-all a very balanced product.,4.0,Positive
"Overall it's a good mobile phone. The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long. Not much, i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about 18-20 hours on normal use.. not many themes available. Samsung is better in that sense.. there are many wallpapers and themes available. Display is clear and camera is also good! Overall okay.",Expected better Battery,4.0,Positive

"Verdict : A Solid buy for this price segment in 2022 (and even for early 2023)There are 2 reviews in this section. Review 1 is 30 days after purchase (Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now) and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update. These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022.Before OOS 13 update, 5G (only for Jio) was enabled via another update. 5G is still not available in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not covered in this review.Review 2: After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update (Android 13):(Update received on 1 Dec 2023).Note: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there were;No Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 (Android 13) update review:Delighters:> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).> Animations are more fluidic.> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)  (Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.> No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40% is too silent.> No Dolby Atomos (which was mentioned for OOS 13). Perhaps, to wait for Stable update.> Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased.> Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.=======================================================================Review 1:Verdict - A Good Buy in this price range in 2022.Note:- This review is after a month's usage.- Received 2 updates during the course of time (Recent update was of 0.98 GB).- System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage.- N77 band is missing for 5G.- The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue.- Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile. No noticeable difference observed. ( In Non-gaming aspect)- Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parameters.Things that are delighting;> Exceptional signal reception (especially 4G+ carrier aggregation). Very fast download speeds.> Insane Fast charging (0 to 100% in 40 mins, 30 to 100 % in 20 mins, excluding trickle charge). No heating of the mobile (just slight warming) during charging.> Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic (Even more than 7.5 hrs, for Videos, YT and general tasks and calls, even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver.> Oxygen OS = Color OS/Realme OS - Bloatware. The skin is really good & nothing to complain like other brands' UI.> Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps. Even some 2nd party apps are ""un-installable"". No major bothering bugs noticed till date.> Yes, the ""Alert slider"" is included, unlike some premium OnePlus models.Things that are annoying;> Dual ambient light sensor (1 in rear and other in front) is not well calibrated. The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required.> Volume level is useless until 40% level (can be audible only in ""Pin-drop silence ambience). Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn't distort & is loud enough.> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm).> Though the in-hand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit.> Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel.> The inbuild DAC (no 3.5 mm hole and only Type-C port) is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.",Really a Good Buy in this price range in 2022,4.0,Positive
"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever. So the first thing I did was to get a back-cover with rubbery finish.2.",An all-rounder phone with flagship features at an affordable price point,5.0,Positive
"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great. Can give 100/100 point.Build Quality is superb.Finger-print is super fast.Mic and loud speaker is also great.",Overall good product,5.0,Positive
